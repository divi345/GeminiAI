# Generative AI App Using React JS

## Project Overview
This project is a **Generative AI application** built with **React JS**, inspired by the functionality of **Google Gemini 2.0**. It provides users with an interactive experience where they can input prompts and receive intelligent responses powered by the **Gemini API**. The app also includes a history feature to revisit past interactions, enhancing the user experience.

## Features
- **Real-time Generative AI Responses**: Users can enter prompts and receive detailed responses.
- **Integration with Gemini API**: Utilizes the Gemini API for high-quality, AI-generated information.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures usability across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
- **Interaction History**: Keeps a log of user prompts and responses, allowing users to review previous interactions.

## Technologies Used
- **React JS**: For building the user interface and creating a responsive, dynamic experience.
- **Gemini API**: Provides the core AI response functionality.
- **HTML/CSS**: For styling and structuring the application.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/divi345/GeminiAI.git
